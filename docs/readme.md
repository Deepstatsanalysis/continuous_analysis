This repository presents [Continuous Analysis](http://greenelab.github.io/continuous_analysis/), a process demonstrating computational reproducibility by producing verifiable end-to-end runs of computational research. The process is described in detail at: [Biorxiv Preprint](http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/056473).
